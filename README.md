#
> ## Technologies
| <b><u>Stack</u></b> | <b><u>Usage</u></b> |
| :------------------ | :------------------ |
| **`Solidity`**      | Smart contract      |
| **`React JS`**      | Frontend            |

#
> ## Repo Setup

<p align="justify">
To setup the repo, first fork the TeamB ZuriSchool repo, then clone the forked repository to create a copy on the local machine.
</p>

    $ git clone https://github.com/pauline-banye/ZuriSchool.git

<p align="justify">
Change directory to the cloned repo and set the original ZuriSchool repository as the "upstream" and your forked repository as the "origin" using gitbash.
</p>

    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Blockgames-TeamB/ZuriSchool.git

#

> ## Requirements
#
- Hardhat
- Alchemy key
- Metamask key
- Etherscan.io API Url
- Node JS
#
> ## Setup the Project
**`*Note:`**

<p align="justify">
This project was setup on a windows 10 system using the gitbash terminal. Some of the commands used may not work with the VScode terminal, command prompt or powershell.
</p>

The steps involved are outlined below:-
#
> ### Install Hardhat
The first step involves cloning and installing hardhat.
```shell
$ cd ZuriSchool

$ npm i -D hardhat

$ npm install

$ npm install --save-dev "@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle" "ethereum-waffle" "chai" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers" "ethers" "web3" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-web3" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan" "@openzeppelin/contracts" "dotenv" "@tenderly/hardhat-tenderly" "hardhat-gas-reporter" "hardhat-deploy"
```
> ### Env Setup
 Next create a `.env` file by using the sample.env. Retrieve your information from the relevant sites and input the information where needed in the `.env` file.

`To retrieve your metamask private key.`
- Open your account details by clicking on the three dots on the metamask extension on your chrome browser
- Click on export private key
- Verify your password
- Copy your private key and place it in the .env file

</p>

#
`To retrieve your alchemy key.`
- Login to your account on https://www.alchemy.com/
- Once youre redirected to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/), click on create app.
- Fill in the relevant details especially the chain and network
- Once the app has been created, click on view key.
- Copy the HTTP and place it in the .env file.

</p>

#
`To retrieve your etherscan key.`
- Login to [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) and hover over the dropdown arrow for your profile on the navbar.
- Click on API keys and add to create a new project (optional step).
- Once the project has been created, click on the copy button to copy the API key.

#
> ## Create the SmartContract
  - First write the Smartcontract codes within the contracts folder.
  - The next step involves the compilation, deployment and verification of the contract on the testnet.

> ### Compile
- To compile the smartcontract before deployment:
```
$ npx hardhat compile
```
#
> ### Deploy
- To deploy the smartcontract:
```
$ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```
#
> ### Verify
- To verify the smartcontract:
```
$ npx hardhat verify 0xD6c7Bc7089DBe4DC6D493E35eaC3dAf5b18FC04d 0xC291B856723080177f983CB32C275D1e56f91841 --network rinkeby
```
- Note for verificition, the first address is the ZuriSchoolToken address, while the second is the ZuriSchool address.


#
> ## Setup the Frontend
- First run the frontend on your local server to ensure it's fully functional before building for production.
#
> ### Install Dependencies
- Setup and install dependencies

```shell
$ cd frontend

$ npm install

$ npm install react-scripts@latest
```
#
> ### Start Server
- Start the server on localhost
```
$ npm run start
```
#
> ### Build the Frontend
- Create an optimized production build, which can be hosted on sites like Heroku, Netlify, Surge etc.
```
$ npm run build
```
#
> ## Testing the Smartcontract

- Coverage is used to view the percentage of the code required by tests and unittests were implemented to ensure that the code functions as expected
#
**`Coverage Test`**
- To test the smartcontract, first open a terminal and run the following command:

- First install Solidity Coverage
```
  $ npm i solidity-coverage
```
- Add `require('solidity-coverage')` to hardhat.config.json

- Install Ganache
``` 
  $ npm i ganache-cli
``` 
- Run coverage
```
$ npx hardhat coverage --network localhost

# if you get errors and you want to trace the error in the terminal
$ npx hardhat coverage --network localhost --show-stack-traces
```
